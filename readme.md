# ArchNode

The ArchNode project is a boilerplate designed for creating production-ready RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express. It follows a modular structure to ensure maintainability and scalability, adhering to best practices in API development. The project leverages tools like Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, dotenv for environment management, and Winston for logging. Additionally, it includes features such as JWT-based authentication, request validation, error handling, and unit testing with Jest.

ArchNode is aimed at developers who need a clean, well-structured foundation for building robust APIs, ensuring that all aspects of the application (e.g., routes, controllers, and services) are clearly separated to promote ease of development and future updatesâ€‹
